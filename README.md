# pancreatic_cancers
The objective of this repository is to explore working with gene expression datasets, taking the use case of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.

## Dataset
1. We have a dataset containing the fene expression data for pancreatinc cancer samples. The data consists of 18465 genes and 183 samples.
2. 25 genes list defining the IFN signature
3. Gene expression in a Normal Pancrease tissue

### Task 1 - Cleaning the dataset, reducing dimensionality via PCA
